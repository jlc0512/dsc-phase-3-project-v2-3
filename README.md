##Overview and Business Problem

Tanzania, as a developing country, struggles with providing clean water to its population of over 57,000,000. There are many water points already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether.

We are a data science consulting company who has been hired by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to create a model to help classify whether water pumps are functional, functional but in need of repairs, and non-functional. We have been hired to help improve maintenance operations minimze waste of the Ministry's resources and only send out repair teams to pumps that are potentially in need of repairs or non-functional. While we want to maximize accuracy, we also want to maximize recall to ensure the people of Tanzania have access to potable water and few pumps that are non-functional or in need of repairs are over looked.

##Data Understanding

The data is sourced from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. Data utilized can be found here: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/data/

For the purposes of our evaluation, we are utilizing the Training Set Labels and Training Set Values, which include data from 59,400 pumps. Our cleaned data contains information from 59,028 pumps.
